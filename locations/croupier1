	Cards with pictures = 10
	The rest of their face value

	(i.e. 9 = 9 8 = 8 etc.)
	After bidding the dealer deals the cards. But note that in our casino maximum rate is 1000 rubles. You two and one currently. Next you can gather additionally card or say enough, then the dealer will begin to gather additionally card itself. So in the end who has the most points he won. Returns 1 to 1.
